Before starting a BSc in Computer Engineering, I began programming as a self-taught learner at the age of 14. Although I am deeply curious about how things work and the theory behind them, I am also a very pragmatic person who wants to translate knowledge into practice, working on personal projects trying to make everyday life a little easier."
